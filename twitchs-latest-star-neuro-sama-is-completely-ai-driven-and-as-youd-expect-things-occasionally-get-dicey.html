According to the channel description, Neuro-Sama has actually been around in various iterations since 2018, however has recently seen a surge in popularity.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>Spending ten minutes on Neuro-Sama’s stream left us in equal parts impressed, terrified, amused, and bemused. The AI does a relatively passable job at playing Minecraft, although it’s likely to find its digital feet sooner rather than later, given that it has apparently already conquered the rhythm game osu!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is Neuro Sama, the first of it's kind AI VTuber and streamer, which not only is playing the game by itself but also interacting with chat…</p><p>It requires moderation to keep in check but is constantly learning and getting better at both… holy <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/u4r3ALa9MN</a></p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href=#>January 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>As far as its interactions with the chat goes, Neuro-Sama’s responses range from entertaining, to eyebrow raising, to straight-up alarming. It acknowledged that it was an AI, before saying it wasn’t, mere minutes later. We didn’t spend much time on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Neuro-Sama’s channel</a>, but here are just a few other gold nuggets which were dropped:</p><p>“I don’t punch elderly people, they don’t make for good targets.”</p><p>“What’s my favorite method of torture? Probably electrocution, but fire is also fun.”</p><p>“I don’t eat horses, but I hear they’re delicious.”</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Naturally, with Twitch being Twitch, the AI is often getting baited into saying some inflammatory things. A clip was shared to Twitter depicting Neuro-Sama denying the Holocaust, even though the AI’s interactions are apparently being moderated. As such, consider yourself warned: you may hear some dicey commentary.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>The troublesome parroting of divisive commentary is quite reminiscent of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a similar AI experiment Microsoft undertook with its AI chatbot, Tay</a>. It took the incendiary corner of the internet less than a day to turn Tay into a racist ‘build-a-wall’ parrot, so Neuro-Sama has a leg up for now, probably so long as it continues being moderated.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=false>Either that, or Neuro-Sama gets swatted, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">like Adin Ross did late last year</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq7ChpJi1tHnLmqueq6RiwLWt0Walnq2ipHq0rcyaZKKrXZi8rrzLnquepKlirqp5w6ugr52eYq6vsIyaqmaxn6qxbrHXqZycrF2ptaq6xqxkqJuTlsCqu82ao6WxXZyytXnDopqesV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

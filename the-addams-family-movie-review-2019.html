Father Gomez (here voiced by <a href=#>Oscar Isaac</a>) and mother Morticia (<a href=#>Charlize Theron</a>) adore each other and are loving and devoted parents to their daughter Wednesday (<a href=#>Chloe Grace Moretz</a>) and son Pugsley (<a href=#>Finn Wolfhard</a>). And their deep enjoyment of what otherwise might seem scary—having an escaped prisoner from the asylum for the criminally insane as a butler, a disembodied hand as an all-purpose helper, applying the ashes of dead parents as make-up, encouraging a child to play with explosives—makes it funny and even endearing instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=0>In this modernized, animated version,&nbsp;we first see Morticia putting on that ashy make-up for what turns out to be her midnight wedding, interrupted by angry neighbors with torches and pitchforks who want all the people they consider weirdos out of town. Gomez promises her they will find a home that "no one in their right mind would be caught dead in." Cue the 'Welcome to New Jersey' sign. They literally run into the above-mentioned escaped prisoner. "Is he all right?" No, comes the relieved and delighted reply. "He seems perfectly demented." The asylum is deserted (except by ghosts), the entrance blocked with yellow crime scene tape. Inside, there are white outlines showing where bodies were discovered. Home sweet home!</p><p data-children-count=0>Fast forward to 13 years later, with tweens Wednesday and Pugsley happily creating mayhem, or happily unhappily, as Addams family members would never enjoy anything so cheery as happiness. The entire extended family will be arriving in two weeks for the traditional Addams coming-of-age ceremony. It involves an intricate dance with the family scimitar, and Pugsley and Gomez are both worried he will not be able to do it. Wednesday, whose long braids are tied up like nooses, asks if she can try going to the public school, where she makes a friend ("Eighth Grade's" <a href=#>Elsie Fisher</a> as Parker) and stands up to a mean girl. This interaction with the "normal" world is intriguing, but quickly abandoned.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lkZmxornSZp2apZmhxm65zq%2BgnmWimsOqsdZmaWlpaQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

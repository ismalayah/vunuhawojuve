Bands I produced were in big festivals, magazines, touring the world, but I didn’t like who I’d become. After hustling for years, living out of my suitcase, and chasing dreams with no money to my name, I became a person more concerned with status and appearance than someone who loved what I did. I risked quitting my newfound success to be happy and fall in love with life again.”</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>When answering a question that asked about his greatest accomplishment shortly after, his response was on a very similar wavelength.</p><p>“Being alive today and being able to share my journey with my family and students.&nbsp;Pursuing the arts can be grim, but it is doable and you have to have a good head on your shoulders. Getting to teach students how to express themselves and see them come into their own personality based around art.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>The “motivated, energized, and passionate” contestant admitted that his unsuspecting nature is what will ultimately allow him to go far in the game, much like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mike Gabler, the winner of Survivor 43</a>.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Admitting that he is “much more emotionally intelligent than most people give me credit for,” will Ben manage to outwit, outplay, and outlast his fellow castaways? Only time will tell…</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>To find out for yourself if Ben Katzman takes home the title of “Sole Survivor” and the million-dollar cash prize, catch the premiere of&nbsp;Survivor 46&nbsp;on Wednesday, February 28 at 8pm ET/PT on CBS, as well as brand new episodes every Wednesday afterwards at the same time.

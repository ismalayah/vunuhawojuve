Silverstone is teaming up with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PETA</a> to encourage people to buy vegan leather over real leather. “If it takes me to get naked for you to care about animals,” she said, ” then that is what I’m after.”</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>PETA, which stands for “People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals”, has made numerous other ads with celebrities for similar causes, usually related to trying to persuade people to change their diet to vegan. In this case, the cause is likely more universally appealing, making people question why real leather is even necessary.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>The organization turned the photo into an ad today in Times Square, showing a naked Silverstone covering herself in all the right parts. The”Wear Vegan” ad reads, “Don’t be a prick. Buy cactus, mushroom, or apple leather instead.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Her message is on point 😏🌵</p><p>The sensational <a href=#>@AliciaSilv</a> is baring it all to get the facts out: leather made from cows kills animals AND the planet. <a href=#>https://t.co/0nhonY9Fev</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/47mUwO7D1R</a></p>— PETA (@peta) <a href=#>December 20, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>Earlier today, PETA took to social media to state, “Alicia Silverstone is stripping away the leather industry’s greenwashing and urging folks to choose sustainable and ethical leather made from plants.”</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>The actress, known for many movies and TV appearances, including the 1995 hit film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clueless</a>, pointed out in a short video of the photo shoot, “The amount of energy that goes into making leather is extraordinary. It’s just not sustainable. The Earth can’t handle it.”</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Silverstone being supportive of PETA is not a surprise considering she published a vegan cookbook called The Kind Diet and has been outspoken about the benefits that veganism has brought to her life. She explained that her dream is “To get Earth friendly vegan materials into the hands of the greatest designers.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>She added that those who make “fake” leather are creating mushroom leather, pineapple leather, and cactus leather, adding about the photo shoot, “It’s why we did this in a cactus field today.”</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Silverstone perfectly summed up her experience of posing nude to try and draw attention to the cause by saying, “I’d rather go naked than wear animals.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SurbXCophmq5mhw6a%2B0q2mp51dpby0sdJmpa6clWKzsL6MmmSpqpmYuK3FjJyYrquVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

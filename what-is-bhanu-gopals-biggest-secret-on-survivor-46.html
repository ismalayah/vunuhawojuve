We lived under a thatch roof, just like Survivor, and when it used to rain, it used to pour. How people are living on Survivor, I lived like that for 18 years. It’s not new to me… but here I am today. Resilient, strong, and determined to win Survivor.”</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>Because of this vulnerability and openness, it is hard to believe that this IT quality analyst has anything to hide, but he shared the biggest secret he will be keeping from his fellow castaways in a conversation with longtime Survivor reporter and journalist Dalton Ross, shared via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>.

I have 10 dislocations, and I’ve recently had a shoulder surgery and it’s still a little iffy, and also, my left knee is a little wonky. It hurts all the time. I don’t want them to know I’m one of the weakest players. Maybe it is good for me, maybe it is bad for me. Time will tell.”</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>Given his injuries — which will likely hinder his physical game — Bhanu is hoping to let his introverted and analytical side shine by playing a strategic game similar to that of Survivor: Caramoan winner John Cochran, but will he manage to take home the title of “Sole Survivor” and the million-dollar cash prize in the end?</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=false>To find out for yourself, catch the premiere of&nbsp;Survivor 46&nbsp;on Wednesday, February 28 at 8pm ET/PT on CBS, as well as brand new episodes every Wednesday afterwards.

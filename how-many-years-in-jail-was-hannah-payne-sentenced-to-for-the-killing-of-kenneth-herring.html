She could’ve just taken the license tag number as she was advised to but instead, she decided to go vigilante. Citizen’s arrest is permitted in Georgia, but only if a felony is committed, which was not the case.</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>Despite the 911 operator having told her not once, not twice, not thrice, but four different times to back down, to stop chasing the man she would later learn was Herring who was not intoxicated as she thought but in diabetic shock, Payne did not listen. She followed after Herring and ultimately caused his death, by shooting him at close range. During the trial, she insisted she hadn’t pulled the trigger.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>But the jury didn’t buy it. Her testimony went against most of what the witnesses claim they saw: little to no hesitation between Payne pulling the gun out and it firing off. And, as the prosecutor rightly pointed out: You cannot claim self-defense when you’re the initial aggressor.</p><h2 id=h-guilty-on-all-8-charges data-injectable=false>Guilty on all 8 charges</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Design-sem-nome-2023-12-21T115542.884.png><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>Hannah Payne was found guilty on all charges, including 3 counts of murder. This does not mean she killed three people. The three counts were 2 felony murders, and 1 malice murder. One felony murder charge has to do with the additional false imprisonment charge, while the other is connected to the aggravated assault charge.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Malice murder has to do with intent, and this, like first-degree murder, does not necessarily involve long-term premeditation. The malicious intent could’ve happened the moment Payne decided to take out her gun and point it toward Herring. The jury seems to think that was the case.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Judge Jewel Scott, poised and professional throughout, handed down a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole plus 13 years to be served consecutively.

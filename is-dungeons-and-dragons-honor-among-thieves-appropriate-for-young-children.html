Nor are comedies — they tend to sport an array of innuendos, lewd jokes, or otherwise mature commentary best left out of a young child’s vocabulary. It just so happens that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</strong></a> ticks all of these genres, which makes it all the more understandable for parents and guardians to question whether it is safe to let the kids tag along for this one or leave them home with the sitter.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Those familiar with the 2000’s Dungeons & Dragons movie starring Jeremy Irons are likely recalling the film’s epic fantasy plot and battle scenes. Honor Among Thieves has that, too, but it also sports more elevated action and a heavy dose of comedy, both of which have the potential to expose your child to scary scenes and adult language/themes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>If you’re considering taking your kid to see Honor Among Thieves, here are some tidbits of information you should know before going in. After all, the last thing we want is for our children to wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-safe-is-dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-for-young-children-to-watch data-injectable=false>How safe is Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves for young children to watch?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>Every kid has their own barometer for how much scary content they can handle. You as their parent or guardian also know which things they can handle and which things are best left off the table. Here are a few details, including the film’s rating, that can help you decide.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>The film’s official rating per the Motion Picture Association of America is PG-13. That means by definition, Honor Among Thieves is relatively suitable for children 13 years old and above. Nevertheless, if you’re adverse to curse words or potentially adult subject matters, heed this caution:&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>You will hear curse words such as b*tch, sh*t, h*ll, and d*mn in the movie, but there aren’t any other serious words such as the f-word. The movie also displays the use of dark magic, so depending on your family’s values, you’ll want to consider that before going in. Additionally, there are several moments that depict death or talk about death.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>We’ve heard concerns from parents that this movie “glorifies thieves”, and we want to reassure them that it also glorifies smashing people in the face with a lute. <a href=#>#DnDMovie</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/foDThk6ZXk</a></p>— Dungeons & Dragons Movie (@DnDMovie) <a href=#>March 22, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>There are no sex scenes or scenes that include nudity, so you don’t have to worry about shielding your kid’s eyes. However, there are a few jump scares (from dragons and other monsters) that could frighten your kid if they are sensitive to that. There are not many instances of severe blood, and the movie steers clear of gore, but there are intense battle scenes with a fair amount of violence.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>All in all, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves holds up to its PG-13 rating and doesn’t push the boundaries. It should make for a fun family movie, and if the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ratings are any indication</a> of your enjoyment factor, then it should be a worthwhile night.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves will release in cinemas on March 31. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read our review of the film here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxllKq7qLHOp6pmmZ6ZeqW%2BwKCmp6tdnbyvu9FmmKannpx6tbTInq2eq12WvbG%2Bzqmpopmkmnqnu9FmsKitnpx6pLTIpZurnZ5k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

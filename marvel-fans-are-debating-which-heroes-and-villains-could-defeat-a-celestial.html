The original post put forward the likes of Captain Marvel, Dormammu, Scarlet Witch, and Thanos but others have been thrown into the mix.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Which of the following characters are capable of killing/neutralize an emerging Celestial with 1 hour left on the clock ?</a> from <a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>The only known Celestials in the MCU to date are Arishem, Jemiah, Nezarr, and Eson. Plus or minus Ego the Living Planet depending on if you think Kurt Russell’s character was telling the truth. Once employed by Thanos, a few fans think Lee Pace’s Ronan the Accusor could be the man to do it: only if he’s got an infinity stone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-187.png><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Another user feels everyone is sleeping on Mantis, who was capable of putting the Mad Titan to sleep for a handful of minutes during Avengers: Infinity War, and was capable of sending alleged Celestial Ego to sleep as well during Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-188.png><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Dormammu, I’ve come to reappraise your abilities to be a menace. Last seen being a silly little goose in Doctor Strange, it’s widely expected they’ll make a return in Doctor Strange’s inevitable threequel. Dormammu was able to pull parts of Earth into his dimension, so surely they’d be a decent shout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-189.png><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the multiverse menace that is Scarlet Witch could do some fun little spooky magics on one? She tore up the Illuminati like a paper shredder in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, so she’s at very least a strong option off the bench.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-190.png><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=false>We’ll likely find out who is capable of defeating one of the Celestials in a future Marvel film, with the potential for them to show up as soon as The Marvels or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, both of which are due out in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8rq3Rr5ylZZaWu7R5wKucZpyVl661tc2gZLCgmZi1brTEq6aeq12Wu6V51aKjpZmZo8Bur86uo51llJqzpq3TZphmm5WhsrTAyJqjaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

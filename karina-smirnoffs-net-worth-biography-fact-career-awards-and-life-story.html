Karina Smirnoff earned her net worth through many performances as a talented ballroom dancer. Born on January 2, 1978, in now Ukraine’s Kharkiv, Karin Smirnoff is a world-class dance champion best known to the general public for her participation on ABC’s Dancing with the Stars series. She first dipped a toe in ballet dancing at the age of 5, and by the age of 9 she fell in love with ballroom dancing. After high school, she went on to earn a double major in economics and information system programming from the Fordham University. Even though she has always seen herself as a future lawyer, Karina eventually realized that her call was dancing. She embarked on her professional dancing career in the United States, soon after she joined a dance school in Brooklyn, New York. Together with her dancing partner Slavik Kryklyvyy, she enjoyed tremendous success, winning several US Championships and fetching other world titles, while being named world’s second in the Latin division. Other ballroom titles she has earned include: five-time U.S. National Champion, World Trophy Champion and Asian Open Champion, among others. As a multi-season, non-celebrity participant in ABC’s prime-time show, she has numerous partners like actor Mario Lopez (with whom she took the second place in the 3rd season and then she dated him), country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, boxer Floyd Mayweather, famed chef Rocco DiSpirito and billionaire Steve Wozniak. It was the thirteenth season of the show, when Karina and army veteran & soap opera star J. R. Martinez turned out to be winners. In addition to fetching gold, she has won runner-up title, a semi-final title, and several quarter final titles. In 2014, she appeared again on Dancing with the Stars, this time partnered with Randy Couture.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKORp7avrYyspKKqnqSzp7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJugqJ%2Bilr2pxYyfmJysXZius7HEq2Sar5GnsbR5wKebZqSZm7Juv9OoqbJn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

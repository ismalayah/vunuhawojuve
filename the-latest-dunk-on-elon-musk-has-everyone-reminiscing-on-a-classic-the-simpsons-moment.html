However, at least Mr. Burns tried a few times to not be completely evil. Musk, in comparison, seems to enjoy emulating Mr. Burns’ worst points, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his now infamous Dave Chappelle-hosted event</a> has got everything thinking of one excellent episode of The Simpsons.</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>“A Star Is Burns” saw the billionaire attempt to become a loved film star and auteur, hoping the medium would help his image recover from being a monster in the eyes of the public. Following its debut at Springfield’s film festival, he and his film get emphatically booed by the audience. Hearing the boos, Burns asks assistant and devotee Smithers if he was getting booed. Smithers, famously willing to do anything to keep Burns happy, tells a little white lie: “No, they’re saying Boo-urns!”</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Life imitated art when Chappelle’s introduction for Musk saw him get eviscerated ad inundated with boos. Never before has the world’s dislike and hatred actually properly reached the physical dimension for Musk. So accustomed to sycophantic fan boys willing to put their tongues where the sun doesn’t shine, Musk finally has seen people don’t like him, and they don’t fear him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Was at the Dave Chapelle show at SF tonight and who comes on but Elon Musk!</p><p>A good 80% of the stadium boos. 18k people. and he withers.

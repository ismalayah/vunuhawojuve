She stated:</p><p>“We’ve been trying to do this separation without the rest of the world knowing since it’s a relationship on which everyone has an opinion.” We simply believed that doing something like this would help us avoid having millions of people tell us how pleased they are that we aren’t together. So that’s what we did. When I speak about it, I get a knot in my throat.”</p><p>In the aftermath of the couple’s divorce, let’s look at some of Zach Braff’s lesser-known facts.</p><h2>3 Facts About Zach Braff You Might Not Know</h2><h2>1) He loves dogs.</h2><p>Zach Braff is a major dog lover. Roscoe Braff, his adoptive dog, died in 2020. He and his then-partner Florence Pugh adopted a dog called Billie from the Labelle Foundation, a Los Angeles-based animal rescue organization, during the COVID-19 outbreak in April 2020. They ultimately chose to formally adopt Billie. In an April 2020 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Braff mentioned adopting Billie. He stated:</p><p>“We believed we were going to foster this puppy, but we did something that I had no idea was termed ‘foster fail.'” And, of course, we were like, ‘We’re never giving this dog back,’ after like 30 seconds of holding it. I joke that we should have called her serotonin since she makes me so happy.”</p><h2>2) He is a licensed pilot.</h2><p>‘Zach Braff has a pilot’s license. He took flying lessons since he was a fearful flyer. He supposedly grew hooked to aviation after taking flying lessons. Braff noted in an interview with Ellen:</p><p>“It’s ideal for a neurotic Jew.” I started into it because I’d developed a fear of flying and believed learning how it worked would help me relax – now I’m addicted. It calms your mind; when you think a lot and your brain is racing all the time, it needs to halt so you can concentrate.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Zach-Braff-1.jpg alt="Zach Braff" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>3) He is close to his Scrubs co-star Donald Faison.</h2><p>Like their on-screen characters Turk and J.D., Zach Braff and his Scrubs co-star Donald Faison are great friends. They even booked a room in New York City and lived together as roommates after the first season of Scrubs. They apparently spent the summer playing ping pong in their undies.</p><p>Faison met his wife Cacee Cobb during Braff’s 30th birthday party in 2005, and they married in 2012 in Braff’s garden in a stunning rustic-themed ceremony, with Braff acting as a groomsman. Braff is also the godfather of their two sons, Rocco and Wilder. During the Covid-19 epidemic, Braff and Faison electronically partnered to produce a podcast series called Fake Doctors, Real Friends, in which they recounted their Scrubs memories and situations. They met once again to play neighbors in a T-Mobile Super Bowl ad in 2022.</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhqZp6RmMG0edOhmK1lqaTCbrrEnptmrJ9iuK%2B71maYm6elqXq7rcKhZJuqkZuzcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

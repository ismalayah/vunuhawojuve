Additionally, Joseph Morgan (The Originals) will play the Church of Blood leader Sebastian Blood/Brother Blood and Franka Potente (Taboo) will play the dangerously faithful cult member May Bennett/Mother Mayhem.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=762 data-injectable=true>Created by Marv Wolfman and Chuck Patton in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Teen Titans #56</a>, Jinx is a character strongly associated with the Teen Titans throughout the decades. She’s an Indian sorceress with elemental abilities that she summons using the power of the earth. She can command the air, use energy blasts to do serious damage, cast illusion spells, and a whole host of other things that make her particularly lethal.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Jinx is imprisoned by S.T.A.R. Labs, but she escapes with the villainous group called the Fearsome Five, who break in to release her. She befriends fellow villains Mammoth and Gizmo and they wreak havoc on the Teen Titans throughout their multiple iterations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-966084570.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1174339085.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-631369644.jpg><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>Many are familiar with Jinx from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Teen Titans animated series</a>, as she appeared in the first episode, “Final Exam.” She was one of the top graduates from the H.I.V.E. Academy with Gizmo, the bratty tech genius, and Mammoth, the beastly brute. Similar to her comic book origins, they fought the Teen Titans on multiple occasions throughout the seasons.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>In season three, Brother Blood becomes the H.I.V.E. headmaster and they follow his orders. Jinx befriends Cyborg who, unbeknownst to her, is posing as the villain Stone, and she begins to reconsider her life of villainy. Instead of changing her ways, however, she leaves the academy and forms the H.I.V.E. Five with Gizmo, Mammoth, See-More, and Private H.I.V.E.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>In DC’s Titans, Jinx is described as quick-witted, a criminal loner, and a master of dark magic who takes pleasure in manipulating others. There’s not much information in regards to the plot, but from the villains included in season four, it’s safe to say that the Church of Blood will play heavily in the season.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>In the 2003 Teen Titans comics, Brother Blood is obsessed with Raven/Rachel Roth, the dark and powerful empath on the team, and the heroes have to put a stop to Blood’s ritual and his evil cult. Raven’s storyline took a backseat in season three of Titans, but she’ll likely get more screen time in season four.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>It will be interesting to see if Jinx and Brother Blood will cross paths and team up to give the Titans more to worry about given their history, but that has yet to be determined.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>Season four of Titans does not currently have a release date, but we’ll update you the moment one becomes available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tculZKOhnq16o7GMoqVmq5WWwLC6jG1kqJ5dqba1rc2sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Just another day in celebrity life!</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Many have felt Barrymore wasn’t being genuine</a>. In a recent interview on late-night show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ziwe</a>, Barrymore addressed those accusations by revealing that although she’s well “aware” of the many privileges she has been given because of her family history and talents, she would consider herself normal.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>While comparing herself to her&nbsp;Never Been Kissed&nbsp;character Josie Gellar, a nerd that was teased by her high school peers and given the nickname Josie Grossie, the 47-year-old said, opened up saying “I am so f–king normal.”</p><p>“I would like to say that I am so f–king normal and yet I’m so embarrassed and aware of how privileged I am. I feel like Joise Grossie but am appropriating normal people I don’t know. My fabulous Hollywood family was dead and gone and had sold everything off. I don’t have a family heirloom. I don’t have anything.”</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>Barrymore also spoke about why she acts the way she does. The&nbsp;Charlies Angel&nbsp;star disclosed it was because she made it a priority not to allow her fame or Hollywood to change who she is as a person. Barrymore says she stops herself from being a “bougie and insular person” by traveling worldwide and fully embracing other people’s lives and cultures.&nbsp;</p><p>“But it’s weird because I lived a privileged and blessed life. I also f–ked up a lot and I’ve seen a lot of s–t. I’ve spent a lot of time traveling throughout the world and looking around and trying not to be some bougie and insular person. I just wish that we could take care of each other in the best way possible. I’m convinced that’s what we’re here to do.”</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Barrymore’s career began in the 1980s after making numerous appearances in movies and television shows.

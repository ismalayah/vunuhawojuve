And R&B superstar, Summer Walker, was no exception until this past year. Until she made it big, the 23-year-old singer-songwriter ran a cleaning service just to make ends meet, while singing was her side-hustle, hobby, and passion. But now that Summer has finally found the fame she deserves, singing is both her passion and main hustle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Less than two years before the "Over It" singer released her debut album back in October 2019, Summer Walker's cleaning service was her full-time paid job.

Her business was called Summer So Clean, and she had an Instagram handle for it, @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">summersoclean</a>.

She also did laundry and closet organization, scrubbed bathrooms, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaned out refrigerators</a>, according to The Face.&nbsp;</p><p>On her business' Instagram, Summer took mirror selfies wearing rubber yellow gloves, she posted before-and-after videos, and showed off her immaculate organizational skills. She reportedly charged $25 per hour for her services, and although she's now selling out shows (and definitely earning mad money) the singer told The Face she can't help but miss <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the “fruity candy” scent</a> of cleaning product Fabuloso.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">While she misses living a quiet life, Summer is now slaying in the music industry.</h2><p>In addition to scoring a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America for her hit track “Come Thru,” as well as a double-platinum one for her leading single, “Playing Games," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Summer's catalog has been streamed 2.5 billion times</a> worldwide, according to Ebony.

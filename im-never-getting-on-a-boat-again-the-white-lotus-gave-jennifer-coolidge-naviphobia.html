Despite the success, it has also unlocked a new fear for the star.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>In a recent interview with&nbsp;Variety’s Actors to Actors&nbsp;series, the 61-year-old disclosed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Max hit show</a> has unveiled her fear of boats, also known as naviphobia. During the June 5 discussion with actor Jeremy Allen White, Coolidge revealed that the reason she is terrified of getting on a boat is because of how easy it would be to dispose of a human body.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>The&nbsp;Shotgun Wedding&nbsp;star delved deep into the topic by describing a possible scenario that could occur on a boat with an individual and their castmates. Coolidge explained if that particular person isn’t well-liked by their peers and they’re out in the “middle of the ocean,” those people could easily get rid of them by tossing them overboard. She stated,&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p>“When you are on a boat, and you’re in the middle of the ocean, and there is no where to go. You do feel like, what if your cast mates hated you. They could push you off… Anyone could get rid of you on a boat. It’s the scariest thing to be on a boat.”</p><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>Further into the interview, Coolidge mentioned another scenario where that tragic tale could occur. This time, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Legally Blonde&nbsp;star</a>‘s example featured a male suitor no longer enjoying their date’s company. Instead of making the best out of the situation, Coolidge imagines them tossing their date out of the ship. While mentioning her fears of the many ways that one could die in a boat have prevented her from enjoying the overall experience, Coolidge said,&nbsp;</p><p>“Anyone if you’re off with some guy that just like all of a sudden he was like ‘I am so tired of you.’ They just push you off and that’s the end. I’m never getting on a boat again because I feel like I’ve thought about that so many times of how easy it is for someone to get rid of you on a boat. It’s just horrific.”</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>Aside from the possible scenarios that Coolidge concocted in her mind about what could occur on a ship, there are no other details, including past traumatic experiences, about why she fears getting on a boat.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>Coolidge and White’s Actors to Actors interview is now available to watch on Variety‘s official YouTube Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2rnnNnq2eql2csrXAyKeeZqeeYq5urs6aq2aZl5a2r3nToZxmr5iewaZ5y6irrqtdnK63sYyjnKemmZuys3nCqKaloZScsm66wK%2BgqaCfl7aiew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The animation studio recently announced that an anime adaptation of <strong>My Life As Inukai-san‚Äôs Dog</strong> will be gracing our screens on Jan. 6, 2023, albeit without many requests.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>From the moment the announcement came forward, anime fans and social media users alike immediately shared their disapproval of the upcoming animation. The manga, which is known for spreading bestiality themes and actions throughout the original manga, immediately stirred controversy among the masses. The original work, written by Itsutsuse, falls under the ecchi category- an erotic comedy. The story is told in the first-person point of view of a dog, who is under the care of Karen Inukai, who allegedly ‚Äúloves dogs too much.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>The story is consistently leading to questionable and downright erotic situations in which the dog is involved. The general premise starts involving a love triangle with the animal, where the main character and another girl, Tsukishiro, share inappropriate thoughts regarding the canine. The zoophilic main character also engages in even more extremely disturbing acts, including sucking a dog‚Äôs tail, asking her pet to lick her feet, and even trying to entice the dog into being aroused by her.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As per the creator of the manga</a>, the story is ‚Äúmainly a piece from the dog‚Äôs perspective. I think you will enjoy the feeling of being held by a girl. The heroine‚Äôs thoughts and feelings are not described from a first-person point of view. I can‚Äôt wait to see how the movements and voices make me feel!‚Äù</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=762 data-injectable=true>In spite of anime‚Äôs constant defying of the status quo, even fans of the genre seem to believe My Life as Inukai-San‚Äôs Dog is too extreme. Some believe the story may take on a different approach, pursuing instead the mystery surrounding the protagonist, and why he became a dog in the first place. Unfortunately, many fans aren‚Äôt too hopeful that it might be the case, criticizing the decision to animate this all together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>RDNolan‚Äôs comment from discussion ""My Life as Inukai-san‚Äôs Dog" New Key Visual"</a>.</figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Bright_One_2377‚Äôs comment from discussion ""My Life as Inukai-san‚Äôs Dog" New Key Visual"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>The official account announcing the news is also currently under fire with the animation studio‚Äôs decision, although some fans of the manga series are particularly excited for their favorite series progressing onto their screen, with some already claiming that the series will become their ‚Äúfavorite anime.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>LET'S GOOOOOOOO <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/klRnIa3pFG</a></p>‚Äî Yabuki (@YabukiH2) <a href=#>March 14, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>My favorite anime üòç</p>‚Äî Setsuna (@Skittle_JP) <a href=#>March 14, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=false>The original manga is still getting weekly releases on Kodansha‚Äôs&nbsp;Magazine Pocket, currently counting six volumes since its release in 2020.

Born on October 18, 1985, in the serene town of St. George, Utah, Gabe’s journey through life was marked by passion, dedication, and an unwavering love for his family. Gabe’s family relocated to Hurricane, Utah, in 1990, where he began to carve out his path in sports, excelling in soccer and Little League before progressing to track, football, and basketball during his high school years.</p><p>His passion for the outdoors manifested in shared adventures with his boys, hiking and exploring the wonders of nature. An artist at heart, Gabe often found solace in drawing, sharing this creative pursuit with his children. Professionally, Gabe found fulfillment in assisting others in realizing their dreams of perfect home furnishings. His employment at Ashley Furniture and Boulevard Home Furnishings allowed him to channel his passion for helping people into a rewarding career. Tragically, Gabe’s journey concluded on December 19, 2023, leaving behind a void that can never be filled.</p><p>He is survived by his loving wife, Jennifer Marie Ross Beaumont, adoring sons, Brexton, Benson, Brantley, and Beckham, as well as his parents, Kelly and Dori Beaumont, and Dale and Becky Johnson. Gabe’s memory lives on in the hearts of numerous siblings, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins. A graveside service will be held on December 22, 2023, at 1:00 pm at the Washington City Cemetery, 300 Park View Drive, Washington, Utah, followed by a luncheon—a time for family and friends to come together, reminisce, and celebrate the extraordinary life of Gabriel Kelly Beaumont. Though Gabe may have left this world too soon, the impact of his love, kindness, and spirit will endure as a cherished legacy for those who were fortunate enough to know him.</p><p>Even at a young age, Gabe showcased a unique combination of brawn and brains, earning the prestigious Eagle Scout Award at the tender age of twelve.&nbsp;His high school football team recognized his academic prowess, awarding him the trophy for the Greatest Brawn and Brains—an acknowledgment of his stellar GPA. Gabe’s athletic achievements attracted attention from various colleges, with Puget Sound holding a particular allure. However, driven by a sense of purpose, he chose to put his aspirations on hold to embark on a two-year mission to Monterrey, Mexico, where he dedicated himself to service.</p><p>Upon completing his mission, Gabe continued his education at Dixie State University, where he encountered the love of his life, Jennifer Marie Ross. Their union on July 27, 2012, marked the beginning of a beautiful family. Together, they welcomed four sons—Brexton William, Benson Hunter, Brantley Winsor, and Beckham Gunner—each a testament to Gabe’s devotion as a loving father. Gabe’s love extended beyond his immediate family, encompassing two angel daughters, Brisa and Kate, whom he cherished with all his heart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJ%2BRl7JursSarKannql6sK7IrayaqqliwrWtx2aempqVYq%2BmrdSmpqesXZ2utHnDopydZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The blockbuster franchise has been going strong for two decades, and you’d be hard-pressed to find a character who appeared in one of them without being brought back for a cameo, a spin-off, or an elaborate flashback meant to sort out an otherwise screwy timeline.
Recommended Videos Hard-pressed doesn’t mean impossible, however. There are a few notable characters who were posed as major players early on, only for them to disappear into the ether and be replaced by bigger stars (both figuratively and literally). <a href=../../what-happened-to-leon-in-fast-and-furious.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../who-is-mile-phakphum-romsaithong-girlfriend-kinnporsche-the-series-cast-details.html>Who Is Mile Phakphum Romsaithong Girlfriend?

We see Jeff cradling Jennie at various points, but theirs is mostly a chaste love, with overtones that feel capital-C Christian—not just because Woo keeps cutting from closeups of Chow's anguished face to closeups of crucifixes (Li's own torments are matched to shots of Buddha statues), but also because the killer's story is essentially that of a devil shattered by remorse, refashioning himself as a Christlike protector of innocents (mainly women, who are presented here as collateral damage from male ego wars), redeeming himself by killing instead of healing, and repeatedly being shot down only to rise again and be shot yet again, shells tearing his flesh like centurions' nails. <a href=../../30-minutes-on-the-killer.html>Read More...</a></section></article></div><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../page/59/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>

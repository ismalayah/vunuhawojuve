On the May 2 broadcast of Fox News roundtable discussion show The Five, the 44-year-old personality was joined by Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, Jessica Tarlov, and Jeanna Pirro in debating reports that Texas Governor Greg Abbott is busing migrants to New York and other “Black-run cities.”</p><p>On May 1, New York City Mayor Eric Adams stated that Abbott had recently abandoned plans to continue sending busloads of illegal immigrants-turned-asylum-seekers to New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Washington, D.C., only to resume the “morally bankrupt” program.</p><p>Jesse Watters remarked on his Fox show:</p><p>“The mayor here is complaining about a couple of thousand people, despite having more resources than any other city in the country?” That is absurd. Now, on my way to work, I witnessed an illegal immigrant family searching through the garbage for recyclables.”</p><p>Tarlov interrupted and inquired:</p><p>“How did you come to know they were illegal?”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jesse-Watters-1.jpg alt="Jesse Watters" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jesse replied:</p><p>“I can tell. I’m sure of it. I’m from the city, and you don’t want me to become involved, but I can tell.”</p><p>Jesse Watters’ words provoked outrage online, with many criticizing him for his callous remarks.</p><h2>Reactions on Twitter to Jesse Watters’ Remarks against immigrants</h2><p>Twitterati was outraged when Jesse Watters’ assertion that he could recognize an illegal immigrant because he is a “city guy” went viral. Several people labeled the presenter racist and criticized him for his alleged intuition for determining who is and isn’t an immigrant. Others likened him to Fox News’ former host Tucker Carlson and asked that Watters be dismissed in the same manner.</p><h2>Jesse Watters went on to express his position on illegal immigration.</h2><p>Jesse Watters proceeded to talk about illegal immigrants after making contentious statements on The Five, calling it the “saddest thing” to watch since they are unable to work in the nation.</p><p>“They came to work, but they can’t work here.” And this is the point. You must be allowed to pick who comes into the nation depending on their requirements. If you need this sort of individual, bring them in. But to just say yes, come on in, and oops, you know, and now everyone is hunting for a five-cent bottle. That is not correct. You can’t blame the man from Texas for that.”</p><p>Watters delegated authority to Vice President Joe Biden, whose administration has seen a rise in border crossings.</p><p>“The common denominator in all of this is Joe Biden.” It’s the equivalent of a lousy boss who doesn’t perform his job. Then everyone on the team starts pointing fingers and gossiping about the other individual. But if the management simply did their job, everyone would be able to remain in their lane. Texas could concentrate on Texas, while New York could concentrate on New York.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jesse-Watters-2.jpg alt="Jesse Watters" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Watters’ statement comes only days after Fox News allegedly fired Tucker Carlson after a racist text message was discovered during the Dominion investigation. According to the New York Times, Carlson apparently mentioned something in the text that was the last straw for Fox, praising a crowd for beating up a suspected Antifa member.</p><p>“Obviously, jumping a person like that is disgraceful. This is not the way white guys fight.”</p><p>Jesse Watters has not replied to the internet reaction to his inflammatory statements as of the time of writing.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Broadcaster</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jesse Watters</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqujmnq4rdOtnKurXZuupLHDZpmam5uhrrS0jJqdrZ2iYrWmecyam55lkWK%2FprnAq6JmmZKkwrV5yKakop%2Bilru1v44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
